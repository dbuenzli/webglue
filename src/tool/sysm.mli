(** System abstraction.

    All [Unix] module usage is confined to this module. *)

(** {1 Environment} *)

val getenv : string -> string option
(** [getenv key] is the value of [key] in the process environment (if any). *)

(** {1 File system operations} *)

val mkdir : string -> bool
(** [mkdir d] creates the directory [d] and returns [true]. If an error
    occurs, it is logged and [false] is returned. Intermediary directories
    are created as required. *)

val rename : string -> string -> bool
(** [rename oldf newf] renames [oldf] to [newf] and returns [true]. If an error
    occurs, it is logged and [false] is returned. *)

val tmp_file : string -> string option
(** [tmp_file f] is a temporary file in the same location as [f] and
    named after [f]. If an error occurs it is logged and [None] is returned. *)

(** {1 Finding files} *)

val make_relative : string -> string -> string
(** [make_relative p f] is [f] without the prefix [p] or [f] if
    [p] is not a prefix of [f]. *)

val find_file : string list -> string -> string option
(** [find_file dirs file] is the full path to [file] in the first
    directory of [dirs] in which it can be found or None otherwise.  *)

val find_file_rec : string list -> string -> string option
(** [find_file_rec dirs file] is like {!find_file} but sub directories
    are also searched in depth first order. *)

val fold_files_rec : string list -> ('a -> string -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a
(** [fold_files_rec dirs f acc] lists the files in [dirs], recursively
    in depth first order and folds the function [f] over the file names. *)

(** {1 IO brackets} *)

val with_inf : string -> 'a -> (in_channel -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_inf inf err f] is [f ic] where [ic] is an input channel
    opened and closed on [inf] ([stdin] and not closed if [f] is ["-"]).
    If a [Sys_error] occurs it is logged and [err] is returned. *)

val with_outf : string -> 'a -> (out_channel -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_outf outf err f] is [f oc] where [oc] is an output channel
    opened and closed on [outf] ([stdout] and not closed if [f] is ["-"]).
    If a [Sys_error] occurs it is logged and [err] is returned. *)

val with_outf_pp : string ->
  ('a, Format.formatter, unit, unit) Pervasives.format4 -> 'a
(** [with_outf_pp outf fmt a0 a1 ...] formats [a0], [a1], ...
    according to [fmt] on a formatter opened and closed on [outf]
    ([stdout] and not closed if [f] is ["-"]).
    If a [Sys_error] occurs it is logged. *)

val with_out_path : string -> 'a -> (out_channel -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_out_path] is like {!with_outf} except the path is created if it
    doesn't exist. An error is logged if the path cannot be created. *)
